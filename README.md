Cross-Course Project for an e-commerce sites called Rainy Days

## Description

Bigger project that has been worked on multiple times the first year. We started out just making a pretty basic website using just HTML & CSS, then expanding on that and adding Javascript and the Wordpress REST API as we learned more throughout the year. It's just a very basic e-commerce site selling jackets. Somewhat of a nightmare cleaning up the mess I made 8ish months ago, but it's a really good learning experience on how to write neat and good code early on in a project!

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Wordpress REST API


## Contributing

As this is a school project i'm not looking for any contributions, but maybe in the future!
